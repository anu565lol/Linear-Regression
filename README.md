# Linear-Regression
This code is for linear regression model testing and training examples are the same for this code so basically texting is done on the trained data itself but it won't make any difference as we are trying to predict the result from the trained model.

I have included 2 files, Test and training.csv they are present in a prticular format feel free to change them but change the code accordingly for the training set.
