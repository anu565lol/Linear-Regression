# Linear-Regression
This code is for linear regression model testing and training examples are the same for this code so basically texting is done on the trained data itself but it won't make any difference as we are trying to predict the result from the trained model.

I have included 2 files, Test and training.csv they are present in a prticular format feel free to change them but change the code accordingly for the training set. 

change the path for the training and the testing files accordingly as they are set according to my computer, and the final result will be generated by the name mysolution.csv in the same directory. The coede for that is in the last line.
